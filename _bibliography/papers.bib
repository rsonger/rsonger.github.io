	abstract     = {Self-directed learning tasks take considerable cognitive effort in the beginning as students are required to make decisions that will have major effects on the rest of their experience. Recommender systems were created specifically for the purpose of aiding the decision-making process, and their use in educational contexts have been no exception. With self-directed learning in particular, students engage in both exploratory and evaluative forms of divergent and convergent thinking as they narrow down their choice of topics and tasks. The issues they encounter along the way relate to their achievement goals and sense of self identity. In this paper, we analyze student responses to questions inspired by achievement goal theory and identity status theory during an interview that took place at the conclusion of a self-directed learning project. Based on the results, we then review evaluation metrics for recommender systems and propose an approach for further research into recommender systems for self-directed learning.},

	abstract     = {Research into recommender systems for educational contexts has come a long way but more advances are necessary for the application of evaluation metrics to academic choices in student-centered contexts. This qualitative study looks at a context where students make decisions for a self-directed learning project and analyzes their dispositional, contextual, and situational experiences from the theoretical perspectives of achievement goal theory and identity status theory. We interviewed 7 students at the conclusion of their projects in a semi-structured format with interview questions based on the theoretical aspects of achievement goal theory and identity status theory. Our analysis of the student responses then identifies their needs during the decision-making process and discusses the implications for effective recommender system metrics. The discussion is shaped by the general aim of designing an educational recommender system that promotes exploratory behavior in students and our analysis reveals potential user types for the design of such a system along with relevant evaluation metrics.},

	abstract     = {Games are often cited for their inherent qualities that make them engaging, inspiring, fun and easy to learn. In education, two separate tracks of game-based learning and gamification have sought to activate the benefits of games and game design for the sake of better learning. This paper examines the strengths and weaknesses of games and gamification to propose an approach that focuses not on motivating with rewards and consequences, but instead on providing intrinsic game-like experiences through play. We address the issue of gamifying educational contexts with discussions about gamer motivations, the relationship between games and play, and designs for optimal learning within games. From the theoretical foundations of behavioral psychology, anthropology and game studies, we then conclude with a model for the design and evaluation of playful experiences in systems of learning inspired by game design.},
