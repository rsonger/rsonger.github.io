In the Computer Skills IB class, 1st-year students learn the basics of HTML and CSS. The final project is a portfolio website for them to showcase other class projects and activities at ICT. We use [Replit.com](https://replit.com/) to build the sites and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host them.

Check out their websites at the links below.
