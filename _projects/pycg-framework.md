The 2022 Software Engineering Lab course had the explicit goal of teaching Computer Graphics concepts in addition to Software Engineering practices. To that end, I developed content for building a software framework in Python that is capable of rendering 3D graphics.

The technologies used are:
- Python 3.7+
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)
- [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/)

This project involved various technical and design challenges, including cross-compatibility issues of OpenGL profiles, creating reuseable object-oriented components while maintaining a pythonic style with the code, and generally documenting the project with easy-to-understand material for beginner-to-intermediate students.

Check out the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/rsonger/pycg-framework) for installation instructions, a demo app, and a roadmap of features.
