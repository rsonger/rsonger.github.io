Welcome to my pomp and circumstance academic profile!

I am an Associate Professor specializing in software engineering, web development, and artificial intelligence in Kanazawa, Japan. You can see my profile on [ResearchMap](https://researchmap.jp/rsonger?lang=en) for the most comprehensive list of my academic accomplishments. Haven't heard of ResearchMap? It's like [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), but it's from Japan. Yes, I have a ResearchGate profile, too, but it remains largely empty aside from the data their bots could scrape up about me.

I currently teach programming and software engineering courses at ICT while working to finish my PhD. The [teaching](/teaching) page has a list of my recent courses and the [projects](/projects) page has information about my research.
