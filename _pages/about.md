Welcome to my pomp and circumstance academic profile!

I am an Associate Professor specializing in software engineering, web development, and artificial intelligence in Kanazawa, Japan. The most comprehensive list of my academic accomplishments is in my profile on [ResearchMap](https://researchmap.jp/rsonger?lang=en). Haven't heard of ResearchMap? It's like [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), but it's from Japan. Yes, I have a ResearchGate profile, too, but it remains largely empty aside from the data their bots could scrape up about me.

I currently teach programming and software engineering courses at ICT while working to finish my PhD in [Information and Computer Engineering](https://www.kanazawa-it.ac.jp/ekit/education/curriculum/graduate/index.html) at Kanazawa Institute of Technology. The [teaching](/teaching) page has a list of my recent courses and the [projects](/projects) page has information about my research.
