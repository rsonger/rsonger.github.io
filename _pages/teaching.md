# science and technology @ ICT

My role in the Department of Science and Technology focuses mainly on teaching information and computer technologies and development.

Each class in this department is one semester (15 weeks) long. Students in year levels 1 to 3 are the equivalent of high school age and those in year levels 4 and 5 are university 1 and 2 equivalent.
